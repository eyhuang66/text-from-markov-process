# text-from-markov-process
Generate new text that was trained from sample text using Markov Chains.

Wrote this code to practice C++, although I would not recommend using C++ to write this type of code since Python and other languages have more helpful libraries that would make easy work of this project!

The code takes in a text file containing text (currently copied/pasted from a section of Taylor Swift's wikipedia entry), generates a list of unique words used, creates a markov chain from the unique word list and text, and outputs new text trained on the original text.
